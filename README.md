# Problem Statement 
Regardless of your investment strategy, fluctuations are expected in the financial market. Despite this variance, professional investors try to estimate their overall returns. Risks and returns differ based on investment types and other factors, which impact stability and volatility. To attempt to predict returns, there are many computer-based algorithms and models for financial market trading. Yet, with new techniques and approaches, data science could improve quantitative researchers' ability to forecast an investment's return.


The aim is to build a model that forecasts an investment's return rate. This will enable investors at any scale to make better decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000 - 2021) (https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data/download) from Kaggle. The data is the price history and trading volumes of the fifty stocks in the index NIFTY 50 from NSE (National Stock Exchange) India. All datasets are at a day-level with pricing and trading values split across .cvs files for each stock along with a metadata file with some macro-information about the stocks itself. The data spans from 1st January, 2000 to 30th April, 2021.
