# Problem Statement 
Regardless of your investment strategy, fluctuations are expected in the financial market. Despite this variance, professional investors try to estimate their overall returns. Risks and returns differ based on investment types and other factors, which impact stability and volatility. To attempt to predict returns, there are many computer-based algorithms and models for financial market trading. Yet, with new techniques and approaches, data science could improve quantitative researchers' ability to forecast an investment's return.


The aim is to build a model that forecasts an investment's return rate. This will enable investors at any scale to make better decisions.
